Submitted to Recess Hacks 3.0 (completed in 26 hours)

For this code to run, please add a .env file to Attune-main 

CLIENT_ID="YOUR CLIENT ID"

CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR CLIENT SECRET"

You can get your client ID and client secret from "Spotify for Developers" and then create an App, and then go to settings to view the ID and secret. 

The website will provide you with invalid spotify pages if you do not do this part, therefore it will not work without the env file with client id and secret!!!!!!!!!
